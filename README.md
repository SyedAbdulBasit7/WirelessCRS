<h1>Wireless Class Room Service</h1>
<p>I created this app in my <b>final year project</b>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The idea is that we build an app that connect to a classroom projector wirelessly to your android smart phones or tablets.
This app is set up wireless screen mirroring between your projector and tablets. 
The Screen mirroring is a wireless technology that allow you to project, or “mirror”,
what is on your smart phone or tablet and show it on your projector without needing to use a cable. 
The projector will present an exact replica of what’s going on your tablets or smart phones, including any movement (e.g., editing a text document or playing/pausing a video).
This is great for viewing local content such as pictures, videos, documents, and professional or educational presentations.
Access University file server on the cloud. This app allow you to use screen recorder and create your first, amazing video.</p>
<p>To enhance the interaction between teacher and students in the modern era of mobile phones we will be providing this application to remotely 
access the data related to particular university by students and teachers and allow teachers to record the lectures live. 
WiCS will also have real time quiz at the end of each lectures depending on the teachers.</p>
